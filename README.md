# Overview

This program is all about learning basic Java syntax. Some of the more extrenous learning objectives for this program
are to get online data and interact with the user via a GUI.

My purpose in writing this software is to learn some Java fundamentals.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough
of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
